Loan Portfolio Risk & Performance Evaluation  
CapitalWave Microfinance Bank | SQL Case Study

This project analyzes customer loan data to uncover trends in approvals, defaults, and risk profiles. Using SQL, I extracted key insights to support smarter lending decisions.


 Key Insights
- High default rates linked to low credit scores and low-income borrowers  
- Self-employed customers pose higher risk than salaried ones  
- Loan purpose and term significantly impact repayment performance  
- High-value, high-credit borrowers are reliable and ideal for retention  

 Recommendations
- Apply stricter approval criteria for low-score and low-income applicants  
- Customize policies by employment type and loan purpose  
- Monitor long-term loans closely  
- Prioritize premium services for top-tier customers
